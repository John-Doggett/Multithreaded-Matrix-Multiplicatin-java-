# Multithreaded-Matrix-Multiplicatin-java-
Simple example of multithreaded applications using matrix multiplication with java. Includes a single threaded and multithreaded example.

Both MatrixMultiplication.java and MultibleThreadMatrixMultiplication.java need Generate2DArray.java in the same package. 
Each test has a main method, but has a method which can be called externall to do matrix multiplcation. Format is two 2d double arrays, with each column representing a column of a matrix. There is no protectin against illegal multiplications, so make sure
your input is correct.
